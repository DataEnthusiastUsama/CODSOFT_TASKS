Data Science Internship - Task Completion
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
In this task, I tackled the classic Titanic Survival Prediction challenge. Using a dataset that included passenger information such as age, gender, class, and more, I built a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived or not. Check out my work and see how data science can uncover historical insights!

Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction
For my second task, I delved into the world of movies. I developed a model that predicts movie ratings based on factors like genre, director, and actors. This task involved data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression techniques to estimate movie ratings accurately.

Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
In my final task, I explored the famous Iris flower dataset to classify flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal measurements. It's a widely-used dataset for introductory classification tasks and helped me sharpen my machine learning skills.

Each task was an exciting journey into the world of data science, and I'm thrilled to share my progress with you. Stay tuned for more exciting projects!
